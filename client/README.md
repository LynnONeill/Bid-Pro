## Introduction:

This project is a web-based application created to specifically target business trades that manufacture custom-built products.  Bid-Pro is designed to be used by a sales team to produce comprehensive price quotes of products with various option and feature combinations.  In it's current state, it has been tailored to assist in the creation of estimates for a company that manufactures custom-built security doors.  Future development will allow businesses to use this application to create their own product base including upgrades, applicable options and respective pricing.
